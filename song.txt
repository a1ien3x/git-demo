My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
i see both sides like Channel
see on both sides like Channel

Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like i am underworld
I hide my tattooes in Shibuya
Police think im of the underworld

12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Whoa)

Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick; Noe, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yeah that's the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull

Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)

2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis

That's a double edge, "Issa knife"
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin'
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick

for commit only
